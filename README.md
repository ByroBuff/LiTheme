# LiTheme
The goal of this extension is to broaden the horizons of themes in chess.com as right now they are missing some very unique ones. I made this extension for myself but noticed many people having a similar gripe with chess.com so I decided to make it public.

## Installation
```
1. Download the repo as a zip or git clone it
2. Go to chrome://extensions
3. Enable developer mode in the top right
4. Click 'load unpacked'
5. Navigate to and select the extracted repo
6. You're done!
```

## Usage
To use the tool just click the extension icon to open up the settings page and choose which board/pieces you want on chess.com. Press save and next time you open up chess.com you should see that your changes have been made.
